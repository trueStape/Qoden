**The point of exercise** is solve as many TODOs as you can. Please Feel free to send your solution if you completed at least 4 TODOs. Every task can have a lot of different solutions, think about your code style, performance, about balance between code style and performance :), and about possible bugs.



Now clone this repository and get on with the task. Good luck! ;)
